## Hi, I'm Kieran

I do 'digital' work in the charity sector, based in London, UK. I try to bridge the gap between website management & product ownership and development.

I also enjoy all the typical hobbies you might expect: film and TV, videogames and boardgames, books and comics, music and podcasts. I've rated ~700 things on iMDB so maybe one day I'll get around to writing a review.

This site is a work-in-progress. It's mostly an excuse for me to play around with Hugo and Netlify, so please bear me if it's a little brief!
